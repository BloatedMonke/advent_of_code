C Dynamic String Implementation
================================

This module exists solely because I'd rather dynamically obtain a file line
than statically assert it's maximum length.

This is definitely not an API, nor does it intend to be. It works well for its use case.

I figured it will be useful for majority of the problems so I've kept it here.
